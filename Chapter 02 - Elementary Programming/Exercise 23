        *2.23 (Cost of driving) 
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter the distance to drive, 
        the fuel efficiency of the car in miles per gallon, and the price per 
        gallon then displays the cost of the trip. 
        Here is a sample run:
            Enter the driving distance: 900.5
            Enter miles per gallon: 25.5
            Enter price per gallon: 3.55
            The cost of driving is $125.36
