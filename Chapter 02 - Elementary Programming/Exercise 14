        *2.14 (Health application: computing BMI) 
        Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of  health on weight. It can be 
        calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing, by the 
        square of your height in meters. Write a program that prompts the user to 
        enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and displays the BMI. Note 
        one pound is 0.45359237 kilograms and one inch is 0.0254 meters. 
        Here is a sample run:
            Enter weight in pounds: 95.5
            Enter height in inches: 50
            BMI is 26.8573
