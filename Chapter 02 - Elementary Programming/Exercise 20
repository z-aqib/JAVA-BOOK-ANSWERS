        *2.20 (Financial application: calculate interest) 
        If you know the balance and the annual percentage interest rate, you 
        can compute the interest on the next monthly payment using the following 
        formula:
            interest = balance * (annualInterestRate/1200)
        Write a program that reads the balance and the annual percentage 
        interest rate and displays the interest for the next month. 
        Here is a sample run:
            Enter balance and interest rate (e.g., 3 for 3%): 1000 3.5
            The interest is 2.91667
