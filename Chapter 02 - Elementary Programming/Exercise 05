        *2.5 (Financial application: calculate tips) 
        Write a program that reads the subtotal and the gratuity rate, then 
        computes the gratuity and total. For example, if the user enters 10 for 
        subtotal and 15% for gratuity rate, the program displays $1.5 as 
        gratuity and $11.5 as total. 
        Here is a sample run:
            Enter the subtotal and a gratuity rate: 10 15
            The gratuity is $1.5 and total is $11.5
