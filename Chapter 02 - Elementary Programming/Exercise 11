        2.11 (Population projection) 
        Rewrite Programming Exercise 1.11 to prompt the user to enter the number 
        of years and display the population after the number of years.
        Use the hint in Programming Exercise 1.11 for this program. 
        Here is a sample run of the program:
            Enter the number of years: 5
            The population in 5 years is 325932969

        /*
        *1.11 (Population projection) 
        The U.S. Census Bureau projects population based on the following assumptions:
        ■ One birth every 7 seconds
        ■ One death every 13 seconds
        ■ One new immigrant every 45 seconds
        Write a program to display the population for each of the next five years. 
        Assume that the current population is 312,032,486, and one year has 365 days. 
        Hint: In Java, if two integers perform division, the result is an integer. 
        The fractional part is truncated. For example, 5 / 4 is 1 (not 1.25) and
        10 / 4 is 2 (not 2.5). To get an accurate result with the fractional part, 
        one of the values involved in the division must be a number with a 
        decimal point. For example, 5.0 / 4 is 1.25 and 10 / 4.0 is 2.5.
