        2.12 (Physics: finding runway length) 
        Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off speed v, you can compute 
        the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to take off using the 
        following formula:
            length = v^2/2a
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) 
        and the acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s^2), then, displays 
        the minimum runway length.
            Enter speed and acceleration: 60 3.5
            The minimum runway length for this airplane is 514.286
