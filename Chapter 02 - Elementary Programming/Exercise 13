        **2.13 (Financial application: compound value) 
        Suppose you save $100 each month into a savings account with an annual 
        interest rate of 5%. Thus, the monthly interest rate is 0.05/12 = 0.00417. 
        After the first month, the value in the account becomes
            100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417
        After the second month, the value in the account becomes
            (100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252
        After the third month, the value in the account becomes
            (100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507
        and so on.
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter a monthly saving amount 
        and displays the account value after the sixth month. (In Programming 
        Exercise 5.30, you will use a loop to simplify the code and display the 
        account value for any month.)
            Enter the monthly saving amount: 100
            After the sixth month, the account value is $608.81
