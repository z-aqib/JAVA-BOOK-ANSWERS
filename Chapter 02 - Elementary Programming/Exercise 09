        2.9 (Physics: acceleration) 
        Average acceleration is defined as the change of velocity divided by the 
        time taken to make the change, as given by the following formula:
            a = v1 - v0 / t
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter the starting velocity v0 
        in meters/second, the ending velocity v1 in meters/second, and the time 
        span t in seconds, then displays the average acceleration. 
        Here is a sample run:
            Enter v0, v1, and t: 5.5 50.9 4.5
            The average acceleration is 10.0889
