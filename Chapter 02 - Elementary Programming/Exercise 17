        2.17 (Science: wind-chill temperature)
        How cold is it outside? The temperature alone is not enough to provide 
        the answer. Other factors including wind speed, relative humidity, and 
        sunshine play important roles in determining coldness outside. In 2001,
        the National Weather Service (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill 
        temperature to measure the coldness using temperature and wind speed.
        The formula is
            twc = 35.74 + 0.6215ta - 35.75v^0.16 + 0.4275tav0.16
        where ta is the outside temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit, v is 
        the speed measured in miles per hour, and twc is the wind-chill 
        temperature. The formula cannot be used for wind speeds below 2 mph or 
        temperatures below -58°F or above 41°F. 
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between 
        -58°F and 41°F nd a wind speed greater than or equal to 2 then displays 
        the wind-chill temperature. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute v^0.16.
        Here is a sample run:
            Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit between -58°F and 41°F:
            5.3
            Enter the wind speed (> = 2) in miles per hour: 6
            The wind chill index is -5.56707

                + "then or equal to 2) in miles per hour. ");
        double v = input.nextDouble();

        // formula calculation
        double vpower = Math.pow(v,0.16);
        double twc = 35.74 + (0.6215*ta) - 35.75 * vpower + (0.4275 * ta * vpower) ;
