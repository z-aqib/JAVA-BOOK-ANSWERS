        **3.24 (Game: pick a card) 
        Write a program that simulates picking a card from a deck of 52 cards. 
        Your program should display the rank (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
        Jack, Queen, King) and suit (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades) of the card.

        // fixed printing line
        System.out.print("The card you picked is ");
