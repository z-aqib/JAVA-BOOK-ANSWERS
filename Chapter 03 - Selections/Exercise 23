        **3.23 (Geometry: point in a rectangle?) 
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter a point (x, y) and checks 
        whether the point is within the rectangle centered at (0, 0) with width 
        10 and height 5. For example, (2, 2) is inside the rectangle and (6, 4) 
        is outside the rectangle, as shown in Figure 3.7b. (Hint: A point is in 
        the rectangle if its horizontal distance to (0, 0) is less than or equal 
        to 10 / 2 and its vertical distance to (0, 0) is less than or equal to 
        5.0 / 2. Test your program to cover all cases.) 
        Here are two sample runs:
            Enter a point with two coordinates: −4.9 2.49
            Point (−4.9, 2.49) is in the rectangle
                Enter a point with two coordinates: −5.1 −2.4
                Point (−5.1, −2.4) is not in the rectangle
