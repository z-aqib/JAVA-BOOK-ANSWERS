        *3.5 (Find future dates) 
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer for today’s 
        day of the week (Sunday is 0, Monday is 1, . . . , and Saturday is 6). 
        Also prompt the user to enter the number of days after today for a 
        future day and display the future day of the week. 
        Here is a sample run:
            Enter today’s day: 1
            Enter the number of days elapsed since today: 3
            Today is Monday and the future day is Thursday
                Enter today’s day: 0
                Enter the number of days elapsed since today: 31
                Today is Sunday and the future day is Wednesday
