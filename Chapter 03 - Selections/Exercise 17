         * *3.17 (Game: scissor, rock, paper) 
         * Write a program that plays the popular scissor–rock–paper game. (A 
         * scissor can cut a paper, a rock can knock a scissor, and a paper can 
         * wrap a rock.) The program randomly generates a number 0, 1, or 2 
         * representing scissor, rock, and paper. The program prompts the user 
         * to enter a number 0, 1, or 2 and displays a message indicating 
         * whether the user or the computer wins, loses, or draws. 
         * Here are sample runs:
                scissor (0), rock (1), paper (2): 1
                The computer is scissor. You are rock. You won
                    scissor (0), rock (1), paper (2): 2
                        The computer is paper. You are paper too. It is a draw
