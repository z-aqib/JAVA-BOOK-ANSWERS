        3.26 (Use the &&, ||, and ^ operators) 
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer and determines 
        whether it is divisible by 5 and 6, whether it is divisible by 5 or 6, 
        and whether it is divisible by 5 or 6, but not both. 
        Here is a sample run of this program:
            Enter an integer: 10
            Is 10 divisible by 5 and 6? false
            Is 10 divisible by 5 or 6? true
            Is 10 divisible by 5 or 6, but not both? true
