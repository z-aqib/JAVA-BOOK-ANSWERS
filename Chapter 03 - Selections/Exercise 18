        *3.18 (Cost of shipping) 
        A shipping company uses the following function to calculate the cost 
        (in dollars) of shipping based on the weight of the package (in pounds).
            cost per weight = $3.5, if 0 < w < = 1
                              $5.5, if 1 < w < = 3
                              $8.5, if 3 < w < = 10
                              $10.5, if 10 < w < = 20
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter the weight of the package 
        and displays the shipping cost. If the weight is negative or zero, 
        display a message “Invalid input.” If the weight is greater than 20, 
        display a message “The package cannot be shipped.”
