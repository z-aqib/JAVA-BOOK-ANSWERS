        ** 3.27 (Geometry: points in triangle?) 
        Suppose a right triangle is placed in a plane as shown below. The right-
        angle point is placed at (0, 0), and the other two points are placed at 
        (200, 0) and (0, 100). 
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter a point with x- and 
        y-coordinates and determines whether the point is inside the triangle. 
        Here are the sample runs:
            Enter a point’s x- and y-coordinates: 100.5 25.5
            The point is in the triangle
                Enter a point’s x- and y-coordinates: 100.5 50.5
                The point is not in the triangle
