        **3.21 (Science: day of the week) 
        Zeller’s congruence is an algorithm developed by Christian Zeller to 
        calculate the day of the week. The formula is
            h = (q + (26(m + 1)/10)+ k + (k/4)+ (j/4)+ 5j)%7
        where
        ■ h is the day of the week (0: Saturday, 1: Sunday, 2: Monday, 3: 
        Tuesday, 4: Wednesday, 5: Thursday, and 6: Friday).
        ■ q is the day of the month.
        ■ m is the month (3: March, 4: April, ..., 12: December). January and 
        February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year.
        ■ j is year/100.
        ■ k is the year of the century (i.e., year % 100).
        Note all divisions in this exercise perform an integer division. 
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter a year, month, and day of 
        the month, and displays the name of the day of the week. 
        Here are some sample runs:
            Enter year: (e.g., 2012): 2015
            Enter month: 1−12: 1
            Enter the day of the month: 1−31: 25
            Day of the week is Sunday
                Enter year: (e.g., 2012): 2012
                Enter month: 1−12: 5
                Enter the day of the month: 1−31: 12
                Day of the week is Saturday
        (Hint: January and February are counted as 13 and 14 in the formula, so 
        you need to convert the user input 1 to 13 and 2 to 14 for the month and 
        change the year to the previous year. For example, if the user enters 1 
        for m and 2015 for year, m will be 13 and year will be 2014 used in the 
        formula.)
