        *3.11 (Find the number of days in a month) 
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter the month and year and 
        displays the number of days in the month. For example, if the user 
        entered month 2 and year 2012, the program should display that February 
        2012 has 29 days. If the user entered month 3 and year 2015, the program 
        should display that March 2015 has 31 days.
