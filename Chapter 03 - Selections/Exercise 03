        A linear equation can be solved using Cramer’s rule given in Programming 
        Exercise 1.13. 
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter a, b, c, d, e, and f and 
        displays the result. If ad - bc is 0, report that “The equation has no 
        solution.”
            Enter a, b, c, d, e, f: 9.0 4.0 3.0 −5.0 −6.0 −21.0
            x is −2.0 and y is 3.0
                Enter a, b, c, d, e, f: 1.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 5.0
                The equation has no solution
