        *3.20 (Science: wind-chill temperature) 
        Programming Exercise 2.17 gives a formula to compute the wind-chill 
        temperature. The formula is valid for temperatures in the range between 
        -58°F and 41°F and wind speed greater than or equal to 2. 
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature and a wind 
        speed. The program displays the wind-chill temperature if the input is 
        valid; otherwise, it displays a message indicating whether the 
        temperature and/or wind speed is invalid.

        *2.17 (Science: wind-chill temperature) 
        How cold is it outside? The temperature alone is not enough to provide 
        the answer. Other factors including wind speed, relative humidity, and 
        sunshine play important roles in determining coldness outside. In 2001,
        the National Weather Service (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill 
        temperature to measure the coldness using temperature and wind speed. 
        The formula is
            twc = 35.74 + 0.6215*ta - 35.75*v^0.16 + 0.4275*ta*v^0.16
        where ta is the outside temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit, v is 
        the speed measured in miles per hour, and twc is the wind-chill 
        temperature. The formula cannot be used for wind speeds below 2 mph or 
        temperatures below -58°F or above 41°F.
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between 
        -58°F and 41°F and a wind speed greater than or equal to 2 then displays 
        the wind-chill temperature. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute v0.16. 
        Here is a sample run:
            Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit between -58°F and 41°F:
            5.3
            Enter the wind speed (> = 2) in miles per hour: 6
            The wind chill index is -5.56707
