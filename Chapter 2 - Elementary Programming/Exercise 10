        2.10 (Science: calculating energy) 
        Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an 
        initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program should prompt 
        the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and 
        final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is
            Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
        where M is the weight of water in kilograms, initial and final 
        temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules. 
        Here is a sample run:
            Enter the amount of water in kilograms: 55.5
            Enter the initial temperature: 3.5
            Enter the final temperature: 10.5
            The energy needed is 1625484.0
